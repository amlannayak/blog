							<h1>A summer in the Bay Area</h1>

                            <p>I had some preconceived notions about the Bay Area prior to starting
                            my internship. A majority of them turned out to be half or mostly true.
                            But what I had not expected was just how much of the Valley is suburbia.
                            I had always imagined a sprawling cityscape that extended southward from SF.
                           	Something akin to New York perhaps. But it's mostly suburbs and strip
                           	malls that span the length of the 101 from SF down to San Jose. Granted, these
                           	aren't just any plain old suburbs (average 2-bedrooms here go for an arm, a leg,   
                           	and the first born child) but they are suburbs nonetheless. Traffic can be a
                           	nightmare, but thankfully, I ended up staying at a friend's apartment about
                           	2 miles from Intel's campus which meant I could get to work without having to
                           	use any of the highays. 
                           	</br>
                           	This was my third internship at Intel. But it was the first in
                           	an architecture group. I worked on both the Xeon and the Xeon Phi products
                           	as part of the Performance Architecture org. My team was responsible for
                           	proposing and integrating new architectural features into the proprietary 
                           	simulator and making performance projections with a variety of workloads.
                           	The project I was involved in was focused primarily on the on-chip interconnect
                           	network and related IPs (collectively referred to as the "uncore" in Intel-speak).
                           	Despite the significant <a href="http://time.com/4304632/intel-layoffs-pc-microsoft/"> layoffs </a>
                           	that had been announced a month prior to the start of my internship, my 
                           	group hadn't been severly impacted. I'm extremely thankful for that as the people
                           	I interacted with on a daily basis, especially my mentor and my manager, turned out to 
                           	be wonderful folks. 
                           	</br>
                           	One cannot simply spend three months in California without exploring the sights.
                           	Initially, my goal had been to try to visit every single National Park in the state.
                           	About a month into my internship, I realized that goal might be a bit too lofty. So,
                           	even though I wasn't able to visit all <a href="https://www.nps.gov/state/CA/index.htm"> 28 </a> 
                           	of them, I did end up going on some terrific hikes. The pictures below barely do justice to the beauty of California.</p>

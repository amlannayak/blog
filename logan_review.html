                            <p><b>Synopsis: </b> <i>A withered Wolverine is forced into escorting a young mutant to safety while being hunted by corporate mercenaries</i> </br>
                            <b> Verdict: </b> <i>4/5 (Go see it!) </i>
                            </br>
                            Though Marvel movies are generally quite fun and light-hearted, in recent years, as more of them have been released, it has been increasingly
                            difficult to distinguish one from the other. There isn't anything fundamentally wrong with them; they are ostensibly well made films with above
                            average direction, engaging action sequences, and fairly straightforward plotlines (these are comic-book adaptations after all). However, there
                            is an unmistakable sense of repitition with every new one that is released. The colors, sounds, and wise-crackery are one and the same,
                            irrespective of the superhero(es) present on-screen. Logan is not the same. It's sewn of a different fabric entirely. If you strip away
                            the superhero veneer, what remains underneath
                            is a tragic road movie with the unmistakable
                            flair of a western. 
                            </br>
                                      Think of it as a comic-book
                            adaptation (though much of the story here is 
                            original) more in the vein of the Dark Knight 
                            than any of the entries in the Marvel Cinematic
                            Universe. What I mean by that is that Logan 
                            could stand on its own as a well-made film,
                            sans the superhero moniker. The claws and the
                            telepathy simply embellish the tale. But the 
                            stakes are genuine. You care about every single
                            protagonist, even the ones who aren't on-screen
                            for more than a handful of minutes. There is a
                            scene about two-thirds of the way through
                            the film during which Logan, Charles (professor X), and Laura (the young mutant
                            on the run from the mercenaries of a ruthless biotech firm) share a meal with a family. 
                            The moment isn't milked for emotion. 
                            Few words are spoken. Yet the effect is remarkable. The mutants, whose lives have been
                            marred with conflict and suffering get a glimpse of the other side - a peek into what a 
                            "normal" life could have been like. But the moment is ephemeral. The mercenaries arrive and chaos soon ensues.
                            </br>
                            Logan also stands apart from its contemporaries due to its grittiness. The fights
                            are fierce. Blood is spilt, bones are cracked, and chunks of flesh are spattered
                            with every swing of Logan's adamantium claws. But he isn't invincible.  His body
                            is now a tapestry of scars. He takes ferocious hits and the effects are painfully
                            evident. The film rightfully earns its hard R rating. While the violence is scaled 
                            up by an order of magnitude, it isn't glorified. There is enough for the audience to
                            fear for the protagonists' lives. And that's saying something for a superhero film.
                            </br>
                            From a technical standpoint, the film's visuals are distinctive. The desert
                            landscapes of southwestern Texas are stark and unforgiving. And the colors are
                            noticeably more muted and subdued than the other Marvel offerings. The camerawork
                            rarely succumbs to the cinema-verite shtick, even during action sequences. 
                            Further, the grounded set design complements the visual style and emphasizes
                            the raw gritiness of the film. Despite the future setting, the world that is presented looks lived in and believable. Absent are any hyper-stylised depictions
                            of an unrecognizeable dystopia. In fact, the world looks nearly identical to the 
                            present day, barring some subtle touches such as autonomous trucks and farming equipment. 
                            </br>
                            Logan is the first superhero film since The Dark Knight that, in my opinion, 
                            transcends its genre. Definitely worth a watch, or two!
